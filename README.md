# C Language Programs – Semester 1

A collection of beginner-level C programs written during my first semester of college.

These cover a wide range of foundational topics including:

- Functions and recursion
- Arrays and strings
- Pointers
- Structures and unions
- Sorting algorithms
- Switch-case applications
- Matrix operations

### File Naming

Most files are named clearly by function or topic. Some are numbered as `Lecture1.c`, `PS1.c` etc., based on the coursework sequence.

### Note

These are practice and coursework submissions — not optimized or modularized.  
For larger or more refined projects, check out my other repositories.
